Texty is a lightweight SMS notification plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Texty is a lightweight SMS notification plugin for WordPress. 

With so many emails coming to your inbox, often it becomes overwhelming to get top of things that you feel most important. A text notification on your phone, WhatsApp, or Telegram may be more desired.

### How does it work?

Texty integrates with 3rd party SMS providers to add support for text messaging.

If you need an SMS notification when a user registers your website, Texty can send a text alert to you when someone registers. Similarly, when a different event occurs in different plugins, Texty can send a text notification depending upon the event. 

Another example might be an order notification from WooCommerce. Upon receiving an order, you might decide to receive a text notification, as well as your customer may get a text notification when the order status changes.
